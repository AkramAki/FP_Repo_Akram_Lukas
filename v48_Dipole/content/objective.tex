\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

The purpose of this experiment is to study the relaxation of defect-dipoles in a doped
ionic crystal.  
By polarising the sample in an electric field, cooling it, and then reheating it at a
controlled rate, a depolarisation current is generated.  
From this current-temperature curve, the activation energy \(W\) and the characteristic
relaxation time \(\tau_0\) of the dipoles are to be determined using two different
evaluation methods.
