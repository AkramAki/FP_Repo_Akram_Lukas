\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}
The aim of this experiment is to determine the activity of known $\gamma$ emitters and to
identify an unknown $\gamma$ emitter using a germanium detector.
For this purpose, an energy calibration is first performed and the full-energy detection
probability of the detector is determined.
