The calibration of the MCA yielded no uncertainties in the fit parameters and can therefore be assumed to be precise. 
However the measured lifetime deviates from the literature value of $\tau_{\mu}=\qty{2.1969811\pm0.000002}{\micro\second}$ \cite{PDG} by about $23\%$. 
This is likely due to the peak in the spectrum that does not behave exponetially, as visible in \autoref{fig:spectrum_fit}. 
Purely statistical deviations are unlikely, since the total count number is $N_{\text{total}}=17254$.
