\subsection{Gold}
The analysis of the gold sample in \autoref{sec:analysis} results in an avergage height of
\begin{equation*}
    \bar{d} = \SI{6.79 \pm 2.52}{\nano\meter}\,,
\end{equation*}
which is much larger than the lattice constant of gold of \SI{0.408}{\nano\meter} \cite{gold_lattice}. 
Most likely the jumps that were analyzed are larger than a single atom layer distance.
