\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

The objective of this experiment is to study the working principles of a scanning tunneling microscope and to apply it 
to investigate the surface structure of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and gold. By operating the STM and analyzing 
the acquired data, atomic-scale features and characteristic surface properties are examined, and the limitations 
and challenges of STM measurements are explored.
